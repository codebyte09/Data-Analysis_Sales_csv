# Data-Analysis_Sales_csv
Repository for sales data analysis using Python Pandas, including data loading, aggregation, and visualization from CSV files.
## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze sales data from a CSV file to derive basic insights. This involves:
- Loading the CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Performing aggregations (e.g., sums) using `groupby()`.
- Visualizing the aggregated data using `plot()` to create informative charts.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**: Interactive computing environments used for developing and presenting the analysis.

## Project Structure

.
├── Data-Analysis_Sales_csv.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook with the analysis code
├── sales_data.csv                 # Sample sales data CSV file
└── README.md                      # This readme file


- `Data-Analysis_Sales_csv.ipynb`: This is the main file containing the Python code for data loading, analysis, and visualization. It's designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.
- `sales_data.csv`: A sample CSV file used for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with your actual sales data.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Data-Analysis_Sales_csv.git](https://github.com/your-username/Data-Analysis_Sales_csv.git)
    cd Data-Analysis_Sales_csv
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)*

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    If you don't have them already, install Pandas and Matplotlib:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```

3.  **Prepare the Data:**
    Ensure your sales data is in a CSV file named `sales_data.csv` in the same directory as the notebook. The sample `sales_data.csv` is included for immediate testing.
    The expected columns in your CSV are at least `Date`, `Product`, and `Sales`.

4.  **Run the Notebook:**

    * **Using Jupyter Notebook (Local):**
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook Data-Analysis_Sales_csv.ipynb
        ```
        This will open the notebook in your web browser. You can then run the cells sequentially.

    * **Using Google Colab:**
        Upload `Data-Analysis_Sales_csv.ipynb` and `sales_data.csv` to your Google Drive. Then, open the `.ipynb` file with Google Colab. The notebook will guide you through the process, including mounting Google Drive if necessary for data access.

## Key Analysis Performed

The notebook demonstrates the following basic data analysis steps:

-   **Data Loading:** Reading the `sales_data.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame.
-   **Sales by Product:** Grouping data by 'Product' and summing 'Sales' to understand product performance.
-   **Daily Sales Trend:** Grouping data by 'Date' and summing 'Sales' to observe daily sales patterns.
-   **Sales Per Product Per Day (Optional):** Shows how sales for individual products evolve over time.

## Deliverables

-   Jupyter Notebook (`Data-Analysis_Sales_csv.ipynb`) containing the complete Python code and analysis.
-   Generated charts visualizing total sales by product and daily sales trends.

## Sample Output

Below are examples of the types of plots generated by the notebook:

**Total Sales by Product**
